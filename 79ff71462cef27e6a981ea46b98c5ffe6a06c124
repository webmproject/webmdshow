      "message": "The reason I did things this way is that I\u0027m concerned a downstream filter might care about frame duration. I don\u0027t think the WebM muxer does, but others might.\n\nTo expand on that: I think it\u0027s possible that use of the simpler decimation method with a variable input frame rate could result in a sample_time(N) that\u0027s less than sample_time(N-1) + sample_duration(N-1)...\n\nSince we only really care about WebM I can change the code to do things the simpler way, but keeping timestamps as accurate as possible seemed like the correct thing to do when I was writing the code.\n\n\u003e I agree with FG. Why are you trying to manipulate the framerate?\n\nDecimation discards frames-- the main use case here is to take 1080p/720p 60 frames/second input, and encode it at 30 frames/second.  Outputting frames at 30/second with frames that have times and durations for 60 frame/second content would be incorrect.",
